    "In the [previous](1_feedforward-networks) [two sections](2_CNNs) we saw how to build neural networks from scratch in PyTorch. Although these networks that we built were surprisingly capable of modeling handwritten digits, they have many drawbacks, including the amount of work required to understand what they are doing and how they work. In general, neural networks have a reputation as being \"black boxes,\" meaning that they are hard to understand&mdash;they are a black box that performs computations but that don't let us see how the computations are performed inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the structure of CNNs and questions like \"why does a certain arrangement of layers in a CNN yield especially good results?\" are very hard to answer without a much deeper analysis of these techniques than this course will cover. However, there are many researchers who study neural networks specifically and who have developed network structures that excel at many kinds of problems. Many of the best model structures are not only available as existing models from PyTorch but also pre-trained on very large datasets. (Pre-trained in this case usually means that they have already been trained to recognize the content of natural images, but see the subsection on *Model Generalizability* below for why this matters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To show how these models work, we'll want a single example image that we can pass to each model. The image doesn't necessarily need to be classified well or correctly, but it should show how each model works, generally. We'll use a cropped version of the painting Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth that has been rescaled to be $224 \\times 224$ pixels; $224 \\times 224$ is a size used by many image recognition models."

    "Most image-based problems that one has to solve in science are not object recognition problems, so why would one want to use a pre-trained model? This is a good question, and an important thing to keep in mind is that CNNs, especially the CNNs discussed below, are large complex models that encode in their parameters a lot of implicit knowledge about their training dataset when they are trained. This means that CNNs that have been trained to recognize the contents of a natural image may have only been trained for that specific task, but they have learned a lot implicit information about the structure of natural images in the process&mdash;their parameters encode filters generally useful for understanding what's in an image. While this training isn't necessarily useful for a different problem, lots of problems can benefit from that internal understanding when they start training.\n",

    "One of the most well-known models that performs classificaion is a `ResNet`, which is short for residual network. The term \"residual\" here refers to the fact that the design of the ResNet allows the model to learn the difference (or residual) between the input image and the output image at each step of the computation. The purpose of this subtle difference in design isn't to create a more expressive model but rather to enable to model to learn more quickly during training.\n",

(For example, `resnet18` has 11,689,512 parameters while `resnet34` has 21,797,672 parameters.) More parameters means that the internal representations employed by the model can be more complex, theoretically allowing it to solve more difficult problems.\n",

    "ResNets are image classification CNNs much like the CNNs we created in the [previous section](2_CNNs) but quite a bit more complex. They take, as input, a tensor whose dimensions are `(N, 3, H, W)` where `N` is the batch size; 3 is for the red, green, and blue image channels; `H` is the image height; and `W` is the image width. (`H` and `W` are pixel counts.) As output, they produce a bank of channels, each corresponding to a particular image category. Pretrained ResNets from PyTorch use the set of 1000 categories defined by the [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/). We can find the predicted category by finding the index of the maximum value in tensor."
