    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are incredibly powerful AI/ML tools whose design resembles that of the human visual system. CNNs have demonstrated an almost uncanny ability to **classify** natural images (i.e., images of the physical world as opposed to computer generated images such as an image of black and white stripes) and to **segment** distinct objects from the rest of an image. These are not the only tasks that CNNs are capable of performing, but these tasks are useful for understanding the behavior of CNNs because they are the tasks on which most other methods fail but CNNs excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the engineering, CNNs are highly similar to other neural network models, and we will see in this section that the definition and training of a CNN it is largely identical to the definition and training the neural network model in the [previous section](1_feedforward-networks), with the exception of a few computational layers in the model itself.\n",

    "Fundamentally, CNNs are just feedforward neural networks (FNNs) that have a particular kind of connectivity structure between layers that both makes them more efficient than a traditional FNN and gives them substantial power at classification and segmentation tasks. This structure was in fact inspired by the structure of the human visual system. In theory, one could build a traditional FNN that learned to perform the same computations as a CNN; however, the FNN would need many many more parameters to represent the same computation as a CNN. This is because CNNs can exploit an operation called **convolution**, which can be performed relatively quickly over an entire image."

    "The basic idea behind a CNN is that it is a FNN whose weights are stored as image kernels instead of as matrices that express the connectivity of every input dimension to every hidden or output dimension. In a CNN, the kernel contains weights that are applied to each location in the input image to produce the output image. This allows the CNN to efficiently apply a small filter to every location in an image. In the next layer of the network, a new kernel can be applied to the output of the previous layer, allowing more complex filters to form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the convolution of images with multiple channels is also straightforward to define. With multiple channels, we can imagine that the input image in the above animation has multiple channels, such as 3 image channels for red, green, and blue. In such a case, we could define our kernel to also have 3 image channels, and our dot products could be calculated over all three image channels, with the kernel sliding only over the rows and columns. This would produce a single output layer, so to produce multiple output layers, we would need multiple kernels, each of which has the same number of channels as the input image. This means that output image channels are formed of combinations of the data across channels in the input, but each pixel in the output image aggregates information from a localized section of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, all of the kernel images are small $3 \\times 3$ images. A kernel needn't be this small, but in convolutional neural networks, most of the kernels tend to be $7 \\times 7$ kernels or smaller. Additionally, all of the kernels in the above examples were applied to every pixel of the input image. Sometimes, CNNs will skip over every other pixel as a way to downsample the input image into a smaller image. This operation is often accompanied by the addition of channels to the output image&mdash;i.e., a convolution will convert an input whose shape is `(N, C, H, W)` into an output whose shape is `(N, C_new, H_new, W_new)` where `H_new < H` and `W_new < W` (for image height `H` and width `W`) but `C_new > C` (channels)."

    "While the exact loss value that your network achieves will depend on random factors, such as the random initial values assigned to the model parameters, hopefully it is clear that this version of the network worked quite a bit better than the previous version and is roughly comparable with the model that we produces in the previous section. We substantially increased the complexity of each convolutional layer this time by adding many additional output channels. This model has a 56,646 dimensions in its parameter-space, making it substnatially larger than our first model, but still only about 5% of the size of our FNN model."
