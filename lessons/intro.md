# The AI ABCs

This Jupyter book is a high-level introduction to using machine learning (ML)
and artificial intelligence (AI) methods in scientific research. Its design has
been heavily inspired by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/),
program run by [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Whereas Software
Cerpentry is a high-level introduction to basic programming tools, this course
focuses on basic ML and AI tools.

Accordingly, this course is intended for readers who have programming
experience but who do not necessarilty have strong mathematics and statistics
backgrounds.  It attempts to provide students with intuition about how various
ML techniques work, how they can be used, and what their limitations are
without delving deeply into theory.
