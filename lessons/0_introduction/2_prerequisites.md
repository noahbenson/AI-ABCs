# Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should already be comfortable with the
basics of Python programming, and you should be familiar with the
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries. It is also helpful to have a
basic understanding of files and filesystems.

If you are new to any of these concepts or would like a refresher, a good place
to start is the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) [lessons
page](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons), specifically the lessons
["Programming with Python"](
https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), which covers NumPy
and Matplotlib, and ["Plotting and Programming in
Python"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), which covers
Pandas and Matplotlib. (Both cover introductory Python materials as well.) For
a review of file systems and files, see the [Unix shell lesson](
https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

The [Python Data Science Handbook](
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is another excellent free
online resource for learning Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Additionally, it is helpful but not required to have a basic understanding of
linear algebra and either basic statistics or probability theory.
