    "If a method is an \"unsupervised learning\" method, that means that it can be used to deduce facts about a dataset without being shown any examples of those facts. A \"supervised learning\" method, in contrast, learns by studying a set of example facts how to predict what facts are appropriate for unseen data. For example, suppose you make a set of detailed measurements of the nutritional and health profiles of several rabbits over a number of years. To analyze these data, you could start by attempting to cluster the rabbits into groups that had similar nutritional profiles&mdash;such an action would be an unsupervised learning approach because it predicts a class for each rabbit without knowing or seeing any examples of correctly classified rabbits. After performing this clustering you might then try to understand how nutrition and health are related in the dataset by sorting the rabbits by the overall quality of their nutritional profiles and assessing which characteristics of a rabbit's nutritional profile lead to improvements in its health&mdash;such an assessment would be a supervised learning approach because it learns the correct association between nutrition and health from examples (the rabbits in the dataset)."

    "Frequently in research we do not have the luxury of correct examples from which to train a supervised machine learning algorithm. In such cases, we attempt to deduce as much as possible from the data itself. We can ask questions about how the dimensions of the data vary, what patterns of variability appear, and can the data be clustered into classes based on simple notions of distance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is often a useful starting point for more detailed analyses because several unsupervised methods perform well at the task of simplifying data. For example, in a high-dimensional dataset like a survey with hundreds of questions, it can be very hard to find patterns and similarities in responses by hand, but a dimensionality reduction technique can easily visualize groups of respondents whose answers covaried similarly. Once observed, such a relationship can then be tested more formally with a model."
