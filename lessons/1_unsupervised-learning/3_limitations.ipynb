    "In the previous two sections, we saw two examples of unsupervised learning: the K-Means algorithm (a type of **clustering** method) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA; a type of **dimensionality reduction** method). These methods are powerful in part because they do not need to know very much about the data in order to work. They operate by exploiting features of the overall structure of the data, such as the relative closeness of items in the dataset or the overall covariance of the dataset's dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work, however, both of these methods make substantial assumptions about the data. Although they work even when the assumptions are violated, they may return answers that are not useful or meaningful. In this section we will examine some of these assumptions and several of the things to be aware of when using unsupervised AI methods."

    "In traditional mathematics, an \"assumption\" is usually a requirement of a proof or formula. If an assumption is not met, then the related formula is usualy unreliably, undefined, or nonsensical. For example, the [inverse trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions) `arcsine(x)`, `arccosine(x)`, `arcsecant(x)`, and `arccosecant(x)` all assume that the argument `x` is on the interval `[-1, 1]`. These functions are all undefined for a number like 2. The Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) assumes that $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a right triangle and that $c$ is the hypotenuse, but if $a$ and $b$ are not sides of a right triangle, the formula will just be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many AI/ML methods, the method performs well, or sometimes optimally, *to the extent that its assumptions are met*. Many methods assume that their input data are [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). Real data in the world may be *close* to normally distributed, but it is only possible to be truly normally distributed in theory. Even if a physical quantity in the world (the volume of a rain drop under certain conditions, for example) were *truly* normally distributed, any finite dataset of measurements of that quantity would fail to be normally distributed by virtue of being finite. What the assumptions of these methods typically mean, however, is not that truly normal data are required, but that the closer the data are to normally distributed the more likely the method is to perform well. If the data are not normally distributed, the method will still usually give you a result, but it will likely be meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "It is important to understand that, even if an AI/ML method's assumptions are not met, most methods will run and produce results anyway. It is your responsibility, when performing your own research, to make sure that you understand a method's assumptions and the extent to which your data meet them!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All AI/ML methods have assumptions and limitations, and understanding them is an important part of using them responsibly and productively. Because this course does not focus on theory, it will not always be able to explain all of the assumptions and limitations of all the methods, but it will highlight the main pitfalls for each. In the remainder of this lesson, we will examine the assumptions and limitations of K-Means clustering and PCA using a dataset called a \"Swiss roll\". "

    "The Swiss roll is a kind of manifold that very clearly breaks both the K-Means clustering and the PCA algorithms because it breaks their assumptions.

We will focus on just the first of these (but we can use the second one to color our plots nicely)."

    "* **The \"distance\" between points in the dataset is meaningful.** If your data are spatial (such as geographical data) then this is not usually an issue because distance is a meaningful measurement. If you provide K-Means with a dataset that has both spatial dimensions and a time dimension, however, it will typically ignore the units and treat the time dimension as if it were spatial. (Sometimes this is fine if you standardize each of the dimensions in some way.) Some K-Means implementations allow you to specify your own distance function, but, unfortunately, the `scikit-learn` library does not currently allow this. In the case of the Swiss roll, the distance between points in 3D space is not as meaningful as the distance within the structure of the roll itself. Were there clusters of points embedded within the Swiss roll, K-Means would not be good at finding them.\n",
