    "One of the simplest and most widely used techniques in machine learning is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a tool for understanding the variance in a dataset&mdash;i.e., what are the main ways that observations in the dataset vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce the basic idea, imagine that you are given a dataset from a colleague who is investigating a new species of moth recently discovred in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada. The dataset contains three variables (columns) and 1,000 observations (rows) of measurements of the sizes (in square millimeters) of three different spots that appear on the moths' wings (the Reniform, Claviform, and Orbicular spots). Each row represents a different moth whose spots were measured, and each column represents one of the three spots. (This example dataset is not real: it was artificially generated for this demonstration.)\n",

All of the PCs are orthogonal to all others, so they make a valid cartesian coordinate system just like the standard $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes.\n",

Because the total variance in a dataset is equal to the sum of the variance along each orthogonal dimension (see [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4664752/247901) for an explanation), the sum of these values is equal to the variance of the dataset. In other words, PCA partitions the dataset into a set of orthogonal axes that are sorted by the amount of variance they encapsulate. Because the initial dataset is also defined on orthogonal axes, this is essentially a rotation of the dataset onto a new set of axes (possibly with some reflection as well)."

Since in our `moth_data` table, the columns correspond to the Reniform, Claviform, and Orbicular spot sizes in that order, the columns of this matrix correspond to the same variables. The fact that the first element of the first PC is approximately `0.51` thus tells us the contribution of the Reniform spot size to the primary axis of variance in the dataset. The second value, `0.74`, tells us the controbution of the Claviform spot size to the primary axis.\n",

    "The last value of the first PC, `-0.44`, is negative, but that doesn't mean that the contribution of the Orbicular spot size to the primary axis of variance is negative. In fact, because we calculate PCs around the mean of the dataset, it doesn't matter at all whether we consider the first PC to be `[0.51, 0.74, -0.44]` or `[-0.51, -0.74, 0.44]` (i.e., the vector that points in the opposite direction). **In standard PCA, the direction of each PC is entirely arbitrary**; if you replace any PC with its opposite, all the PCs will remain orthogonal, and the variance along that PC remains the same. In general, it's best to think of each PC as indicating an *axis* that points in both directions rather than a vector that points in one direction.\n",

    "Given that each PC is equivalent to its opposite, then, how should one interpret the signs of the elements of the PCs? When two values in a PC have different signs, it indicates that the covariance of the two components is negative. In other words, when one of the dimensions tends to be large the other dimension tends to be small, and vice versa. For example, in PC1 of the PCA we just ran (`[0.51, 0.74, -0.44]`) the Claviform spot size has a value of `0.74` while the Orbicular spot size has a negative value of `-0.44`. This indicates that the variance along the first principal axis is characterized by a trade-off in which the Orbicular spot tends to be smaller than its mean size when the Claviform spot tends to be larger than its mean size and vice versa. In contrast, the Reniform spot has a value of `0.51`, indicating that when the Claviform spot is larger than its mean, the Reniform spot also tends to be larger than its mean (but not quite as much larger, given that `0.51 < 0.74`)."

    "Given this observation&mdash;that there is approximately 0 variance along the final principal axis&mdash;it is sensible to reduce the dataset to just 2 dimensions. Clearly there are only two meaningful dimensions to the underlying data because the data lie in a 2D plane. Rather than plot the data in 3D, we can instead plot the data in 2D, but instead of using any of the dataset's original axes (i.e., an axis for each of the spots), we would use the first two PCs. These axes don't nearly correspond to individual spots, so they should not be labeled as such. A 2D representation is still useful, however, because it allows one to see the approximate distance between spots and the shape of their approximate distribution without needing to rotate the dataset in 3D. This is only slightly useful when dealing with 3D data, but in many real-world datasets, there are more than 3 dimensions, making visualization of the raw data in a single plot impossible. If the structure of the data can be approximated with just 2 dimensions, that can be very valuable.\n",

    "One thing that is quite clear from this simple view of the dataset is that there are a number of points that are substantial outliers. Since the first three PCs represent about two thirds of the variance, we can be pretty certain than most outliers in this representation of the points will be outliers in the entire dataset. PCA is strongly affected by outliers because as the distance between the dataset's mean and a point increases, the variance increases by the square of that distance. When PCA finds the rotation that maximizes variance explained by the first PC, it is more important for the algorithm to account for a single outlier, whose contribution to the variance is high, than it is to account for a single point near the mean whose contribution to the variance is low. For these reasons, it is fairly common to remove substantial outliers before running PCA."
