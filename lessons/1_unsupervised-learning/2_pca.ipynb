    "One of the simplest and most widely used techniques in machine learning is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a tool for understanding the variance in a dataset&mdash;i.e., what are the main ways that observations in the dataset vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce the basic idea, imagine that you are given a dataset that contains three variables (columns) and 1,000 observations (rows). The dataset contains the measurements of the sizes (in square centimeters) of three different spots that appear on the wings of a particular kind of butterfly. Each row represents a different butterfly whose spots were measured, and each column represents one of the spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the data do not appear unusual. You examine the mean and standard deviation of each spot's size and find the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "|spot|mean|standard deviation|\n",
    "|:--:|:--:|:------:|\n",
    "|1 ($x$-axis)|1.2 cm$^2$| 0.095 cm$^2$|\n",

    "|3 ($z$-axis)|0.4 cm$^2$| 0.065 cm$^2$|\n",
    "\n",
    "You might suspect that there is some covariance in the spots, so you might go ahead and make plots of each size versus each other:"
