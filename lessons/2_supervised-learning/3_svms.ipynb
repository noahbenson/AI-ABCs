    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are among the most studied and well-understood methods in machine learning. Like linear regression and random forests, they can be used for either classifications or for regression or even for (unsupervised) outlier detection (see the [`OneClassSVM` type](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html) in Scikit-learn for more information), but in this section of the lesson, we'll focus on using them as classifiers.\n",

    "SVMs find a hyperplane (or a set of hyperplanes if the input data contain more than 2 classes) that best separates the data into the distinct target classes (i.e., one class on one side of the plane and the other class on the other side).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A \"hyperplane\" is just an $n$-dimensional plane. In 1D, a hyperplane is a point; in 2D, it's a line; in 3D, it's a plane, and beyond 3D we just call it a \"hyperplane\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the hyperplane that separates classes can be performed efficiently and deterministically, which is a large part of why SVMs are successful. However, it is very limiting: in many datasets, classes are not separated by a plane but rather by a complex surface, and, generally speaking, when a hyperplane can separate classes, simpler methods like linear regression also tend to work well. Because of these limitations, SVMs use what's known as a \"[kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method)\" in which they transform the input data into an equivalent high-dimensional feature space then transform that high-dimensional space. After the space has been transformed, hyperplanes can potentially form much more complex and relevant surfaces in the untransformed original feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully understanding the kernel trick requires a deep dive into the relevant math, which we won't do in this course. The important thing to understand is that SVMs excel at separating classes by hyperplanes, and they can use the kernel trick in conjunction with these hyperplanes to effectively divide classes using non-linear surfaces instead of just (linear) hyperplanes."

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVMs handle very high-dimensional datasets well. Some datasets, such as a dataset of high-resolution images, inherently have high dimensionality. High-resolution images have 1 dimension per image pixel and per channel, so, for example, a $640 \\times 480$ RGB image contains $640 \\times 480 \\times 3 = 921,600$ dimensions (the 3 comes from the red/green/blue channels of the image) because each channel of each pixel contains a distinct independent value. Each of these values is a unique feature, and each image is an observation in the dataset.\n",
    "* SVMs also tend to handle [sparse data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) well. Sparse data occurs when there are many features but most of them have null values (e.g., in numerical data, most of the features are 0). Text data is often represented sparsely, for example by assigning each column of a matrix a different word or concept, then encoding a block of text as a row by marking a 1 in the appropriate column for any word present in the block and leaving the remaining colums equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```{note}\n",
    "  Sparse data in AI/ML creates many kinds of special circumstances and problems and is its own subdomain of data science research. This course doesn't discuss sparse data in detail; a (highly technical) theoretical overview of sparse data methods can be found in this [online book](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/IterMethBook_2ndEd.pdf). A more practical introduction to sparse data can be found in the [scipy documentation on sparse arrays](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/sparse.html).\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* SVMs tend to be robust to overfitting. With good cross-validation, overfitting can often be avoided, but SVMs tend to be more resistant to overfitting than many other ML methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVMs can't handle non-numerical data. Non-numerical data are very common, especially in demographic and survey data. An example of a non-numeric feature is a person's ABO blood-type, which is one of a few categories (`A`, `B`, `AB`, or `O`). For a dataset with non-numerical data, one would typically use a method called one-hot encoding to create a sparse numerical representation that works with SVMs. We won't discuss one-hot encoding in this lesson, but Scikit-learn includes a built-in [`OneHotEncoder`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) class to make this conversion automatically.\n",
    "* SVMs are sensitive to the scales of the input features; for this reason it's almost always important to normalize a dataset's features for use with SVMs. This normalization is important but is also the source of a lot of bugs&mdash;if the training data are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, then the test data (and any data subsequently used with the SVM) must be normalized exactly the same way, meaning that the mean and standard deviation of the *training* dataset must be used to normalize any data to which the model is applied after training.\n",
    "* SVMs can be hard to interpret; although the idea of separating points with different classes by a hyperplane is fairly intuitive, how this works in high dimensions and when a kernel transformation is present can be very unintuitive.\n",
    "* What kernel to use and whether to use one are important hyperparameters of SVM. Whether SVM will work well or not can depend heavily these choices. If the classes can be separated linearly, then a kernel is not necessary, but for nonlinear data, the correct choice can be very important."

    "In the immediately previous section, we did something that is common-place when handling and analyzing data but which is nonetheless problematic. What we did was try out a model, then, when it didn't work as well as we had hoped, we tried a different hyperparameter using the same training and test datasets. Why do you think is this a problem?\n",

    "Recall that when we discussed cross-validation at the beginning of this lesson, the issue that cross-validation protects against is overfitting, in which the model is fit to its training data so well that it models the noise in the dataset. To avoid this, we update (train) the model only using the training data but we evaluate (test) the model only using the test data. This split prevents the model from fitting noise because it can only fit noise in the training dataset and never the test dataset.\n",

We have updated a hyperparameter based on the test data performance, which can potentially result in a set of hyperparameters that induce the model to fit noise in the test dataset.\n",

    "In this particular case, the single change of a single hyperparameter is unlikely to have much of an effect on the accuracy of the resulting model, but the scenario explained above is a real problem that should be avoided. The typical approach for avoiding this is to use a nested split of the data into a **training subdataset**, a **test subdataset**, *and* a **validation subdataset**. The training and test datasets are used as described above, but the validation dataset is used only after a final model has been trained and no further decisions about hyperparameters are to be made. Ideally, the validation dataset should not really be examined prior to its use to validate a model.\n",
